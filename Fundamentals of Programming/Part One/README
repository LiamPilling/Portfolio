README         - readme file for the TaskOne directory
Hypothesis.txt - This is a file containing all of the hypothesis that I have
                 made for Task One
2011Census_B01_WA_POA_short.csv - This is a csv file used for all the programs
                 listed below. It contains all of the population data for WA 
                 listed by postcode. It contains data for populations of men and
                 women, ages and more for the year 2011. This file was taken out
                 of the datapack from https://datapacks.censusdata.abs.gov.au/da
                 tapacks.
2016Census_G01_WA_POA.csv - This is a csv file used for all the programs
                 listed below. It contains all of the population data for WA 
                 listed by postcode. It contains data for populations of men and
                 women, ages and more for the year 2016. This file was taken out
                 of the datapack from https://datapacks.censusdata.abs.gov.au/da
                 tapacks.
hypoOne.py     - This file is a program to confirm the first hypothesis stated
                 in Hypothesis.txt. It takes the data from the two datasets
                 above and compares the populations living in mining towns from
                 2011 to 2016. It outputs the results of the data to the
                 terminal and generates the file 'HypoOneGraph.png', which is a
                 graph of the populations.
hypoTwo.py     - This file is a program to confirm the second hypothesis stated
                 in Hypothesis.txt. It takes the data from the 2016 dataset and 
                 uses it to compare populations of men and women in different 
                 areas of WA. It outputs the results of the data to the terminal
                 and generates the files 'HypoTwoPopGraph.png', which is a grap 
                 of the populations of men and women, and 
                 'HypoTwoRatioGraph.png', which is a graph of the ratios of men
                 to women.
hypoThree.py   - This file is a program to confirm the third hypothesis stated
                 in Hypothesis.txt. It takes the data from the two datasets and
                 uses it to compare increase in growth of senoirs in south west 
                 WA comprared to the growth of all of WA. It displays the 
                 results to the terminal and generates the file 
                 'HypoThreeGraph.png', which is a graph of the populations of 
                 seniors in south west WA in 2011 and in 2016.
