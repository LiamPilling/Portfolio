sweep.sh       - A bash script that performs a parameter sweep for the 
                 dosagebase.py and checkResults.py files. It takes in two 
                 parametres, the start dosage and the end dosage. It 
                 automatically does one step intervals and steps up the dosage
                 by 25. It runs two sweeps, one for the PolyJuice drug and one
                 for the NiLess drug. At the end of the sweeps it runs the 
                 checkResults.py and prints to the screen the successful trials
                 All of the results are written to a new folder containing the 
                 graphs, the generated results files for the two drugs and
                 copies of the sweep.sh, dosagebase.py and checkresults.py 
                 programs. The output of dosagebase.py is writted to the results
                 files and then automatically read by checkResults.py to output
                 them to the screen in an efficient way.
dosagebase.py  - This is a file to see if the given parameters for a description
                 of a drug has an effective result. The file takes in seven
                 command line parameters from the sweep.sh file, and runs a
                 sumulation of the drugs effect over 200 hours. If the 
                 simulation is deemed successful it will print the simulation 
                 details and graph them to a file with the format 'dosage_I' + 
                 interval + '_D' + dosage + '.png. Eg, 'dosage_I1_D100000.png'.
checkResults.py- This file will read the given results of the NiLess or 
                 PolyJuice drugs using regex and output to the screen just the 
                 effective time, the dosage and the interval.
